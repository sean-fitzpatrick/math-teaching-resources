        <p>
          As you embark upon your study of calculus in this course (Math 1560),
          you likely have many questions, such as: <q>What is Calculus, anyway?</q>
          and <q>Is this on the test?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition to online teaching prompts even more questions.
          This outline is intended to serve as a roadmap,
          to guide you through the various components of the course.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Welcome to Math 1560, Calculus I.
          I'm glad you've chosen to embark on this journey through a mathematical classic.
          The Fall 2020 offering of this course will be an adventure,
          as we attempt to offer the course fully online for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's get one thing out of the way before we begin:
          Calculus I isn't nearly as bad as its reputation might suggest.
          Most students do well in Math 1560 <fn>In Fall 2019, out of 262 students who completed the course,
          104 received a grade of A- or better. (That's almost 40% of the class.)
          More than two thirds of the class received A or B grades.</fn>.
          We will do our best to support you in your online learning,
          and ensure that students continue to do well in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin with some introductions: to the university, to the staff, and to the course.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-welcome">
        <title>Welcome to the University of Lethbridge</title>
        <p>
          Oki, and welcome to the University of Lethbridge.
          Our University’s Blackfoot name is Iniskim, meaning Sacred Buffalo Stone.
          The University of Lethbridge acknowledges and deeply appreciates the Siksikaitsitapii peoples’ connection to their traditional territory.
          We, as people living and benefiting from Blackfoot Confederacy traditional territory,
          honour the traditions of people who have cared for this land since time immemorial.
          We recognize the diverse population of Aboriginal peoples who attend the University of Lethbridge and the
          contributions these Aboriginal peoples have made in shaping and strengthening the University community in the
          past, present, and in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of you, this is your first semester at the University of Lethbridge,
          or at any post-secondary institution.
          University is an exciting time. You'll be exposed to new people,
          new ideas, and new experiences.
          Making connections as we learn remotely will be a challenge,
          but somehow we'll do our best to make this happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of your courses, including this one, will be facilitated using the
          <url href="https://moodle.uleth.ca">Moodle</url> learning management system.
          You'll want to spend time as soon as you can familiarizing yourself with your course Moodle pages,
          and plan to check each one on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transitioning to learning in the university environment is a challenge at the best of times.
          Doing so in the middle of a global pandemic while also trying to learn online,
          and learn to use all the technological tools needed for that, will be additionally challenging.
          Everyone here at U of L will be doing our best to help you through this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.
          I'll do my best to answer all of your course-related questions as quickly as possible.
          (See <xref ref="section-communication">Section</xref> for details on how to get in touch.)
          If you have questions that are not related to the course,
          you can ask those too, and I'll try to answer, or to direct you to someone who can.

          Math 1560 is running in three sections for Fall 2020: A, B, and C.
          My name is <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat">Sean Fitzpatrick</url>.
          I'm in charge of all three lecture sections (A, B, and C).
          I can be reached via email at

          Tutorial sections 4, 9, 11, and 12 are taught by <url href="mailto:jana.archibald@uleth.ca">Dr. Jana Archibald</url>.
          All the other tutorial sections are taught by <url href="mailto:azar.eftekharitarghi@uleth.ca">Azar Efekhari Targhi</url>.
          Jana and Azar handled our Summer 2020 offering of Math 1560,
          so they've already had their first adventure in teaching calculus online,
          and I'll be relying on their experience and expertise with what works best online.

        <title>Course description</title>
        <p>
          This is Math 1560, Calculus I. It's a first course in calculus,
          covering limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of one variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll be dealing with all your favourite functions from high school:
          polynomials, logarithms, exponentials, even trigonometric functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><term>Limits</term> tell us about the value of a function near a point.
            A limit is simulataneously approximate and precise. In fact, most of calculus could be described as <q>the art of precise approximation</q></li>
            <li><term>Derivatives</term> tell us about how a function is <em>changing</em> near a point.
            Most rates of change in the sciences, from speed to population growth, are quantified using derivatives.</li>
            <li><term>Integrals</term> will be defined in the context of calclating area,
            but they also appear whenever aggregates or averages are being considered.</li>
          </ul>
          Both derivatives and intergrals are defined using limits, and the two are related in a (possibly) surprising way.

          The primary course website is <url href="https://moodle.uleth.ca">Moodle</url>.
          On Moodle, you can expect to find:

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>

          As you learn to navigate online learning (and as I learn how to guide you),
          the weekly topics schedules will be key to staying on top of your course material.
          Every week you can expect to receive details on readings, videos,
          homework, and assessments, as well as information on what will be taking place in class,
          and how to access those classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case there's a day when Moodle isn't working properly and you need access to course materials,
          you can find some of them (like this syllabus) on my <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/teaching.html">personal website</url>.

          Math 1560 will be taught using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction.
          Asynchronous components are explained in later sections.
          We have maintained the originally scheduled class meeting times,
          which are as follows:

        <p>
          There is also a weekly <em>tutorial</em>.
          Tutorials take place on Thursday and Friday.
          Since there are 12 tutorial sections, we won't list them all here.
          The easiest way to access your tutorial information is by looking up your personal schedule on <url href="https://bridge.uleth.ca/">the Bridge</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our synchronous class meetings will come in two types.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <title>Monday Q&amp;A</title>
              <p>
                On Mondays, I will broadcast via YouTube live.
                The broadcast will be accompanied by a live Q&amp;A session on our discussion forum.
                You will be able to use the forum ahead of time to vote for the topics
                and homework problems you most want to see covered.
                I will cover those problems in the live feed.
                Note that the live feed is automatically recorded,
                and will be available for you to review at any time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Wednesday problem sessions</title>
              <p>
                On Wednesdays, you will be the ones doing the problem solving.
                I will present you with questions to work on in groups.
                The questions will be provided ahead of time, and submitted later,
                but this will be your opportunity to work on those problems with both peer and instructor support.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutorials will also be synchronous, and facilitated by a tutorial instructor.
          You will use tutorials to work on the basic computational skills essential to success in calculus.
          Work in tutorial will be graded for feedback.

        <title>Course textbook</title>
        <p>
          Our course textbook is <init>APEX</init> Calculus, by Greg Hartman.
          This book is an <term>open education resource</term> (<init>OER</init>).
          That means that the book is fully free, both in terms of cost,
          your freedom to use and share the book however you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last year or so,
          I've been working with Greg and others to convert the textbook to a system called <pretext/>.
          The <pretext/> language allows us to write a book that can be produced in a variety of formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a <init>PDF</init> version (the original format of the book),
          which will be available on Moodle.
          The <init>PDF</init> version is useful if you want to print the book,
          or simply want to be able to read when there is no access to internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real advantage of <pretext/> is that we can output to <init>HTML</init> format.
          The <init>HTML</init> version of the textbook can be found at
          <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/apex-calculus"/>.
          This version of the book can be read on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
          It also contains a number of nice features, including embedded videos,
          interactive graphics, and annotation tools.

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-grading">
        <title>Grading scheme</title>
        <p>
          Traditionally Math 1560 has been a mostly skills-focused course:
          the focus was on learning how to compute limits and derivatives,
          and the tests mostly checked your proficiency in these skills.
          This doesn't work well online, when most routine calculations can be done easily on the computer!
          Our assessment principles this year:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                No big high stakes assessments: lots of little ones instead.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                More concepts, and less rote computation.
                (Less <mdash/> not none. Your follow-on courses will still assume you know how to take a derivative.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Classes (the synchronous part) will be used for work, not lecture.
                (Nobody wants to sit though a 75 minute Zoom lecture on Calculus, including your instructor.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Group work is good for you. (Even if you don't always like it!)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The various graded components of the course are explained below.
          At first it will seem like there's a lot to do!
          But most items are small, and many can be done during class time.
        </p>

              <title>Tutorials (10%)</title>
              <p>
                Every tutorial will involve an assignment to be completed.
                You will be encouraged to work on these problems in groups,
                but each student will submit their own work for evaluation.
                Evaluation will be strictly <em>formative</em>:
                you will receive feedback on the work that you submit,
                but any sincere demonstration of effort will receive full credit.

                The homework, like tutorial,
                will focus on building fluency with the computational procedures of calculus.
                Homework will be delivered through the <term>WeBWorK</term> online homework system.
                See <href ref="section-webwork"/> for details.

              <title>Assignments (10%)</title>
              <p>
                Assignments will be done in groups,
                and there will be time set aside in each class to work on them.
                Each assignment have only one or two problems,
                but these will typically involve multiple steps,
                and you will be expected to provide a written explanation
              </p>

              <title>Tests (65%)</title>
              <p>
                Each of the five chapters will conclude with a test.
                The test will be open book. There will be a time limit,
                but you will have some flexibility in terms of when you choose to begin.
                Details on test dates can be found in <href ref="section-schedule"/>.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Prior to each test you will be asked to submit a <q>study sheet</q>.
                      This will be worth 2 points.

                    <p>
                      You will write the test <em>individually</em>,
                      and submit via <term>Crowdmark</term>.
                      The individual test will be worth 6 points.

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After the individual test, there will be a follow-up <em>group test</em>.
                      This will take place in class, and will be worth 2 points.

                      After your test has been graded,
                      you will be asked to submit a short reflection piece,
                      where you comment on your performance and the feedback you receive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Typically, you will be asked to comment on the following:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What did you do to prepare for the test?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What types of mistakes did you make on the test?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What (if anything) could you do differently next time?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Post-test reflection will also be worth 2 points.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                      There are five tests in total.
                      I will automatically take your best 4 out of 5 test scores.
                      That way you can miss a test (or have a bad day) without affecting your grade.

                To encourage you to keep up to date with the textbook readings/videos,
                there will be a weekly quiz, delivered via WeBWorK.
                The quiz questions will check your reading; not your math.
                Reading questions will be due by 8 am every Wednesday.
                The main purpose of the questions is for me to be able to identify
                (from your responses) what areas of the content need to be addressed in class.
                Typically any reasonable effort to answer will receive full credit.

      <title>Communication</title>
      <p>
        The following communication channels are available in this course:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Forums</title>
            <p>
              There will be a primary course Q&amp;A forum using <url href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</url>.
              We use Piazza rather than the internal Moodle forums due to a couple of useful features:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Students can choose to remain anonymous (to their peers) when asking a question.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    There is a <q>live</q> Q&amp;A feature that we can use during class.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Piazza forum should be your primary communication channel.
              In particular, any questions about homework and course content should be asked on Piazza,
              since I can reply there with mathematical notation.
              You will also get a much faster reply on the forum than you will from email.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is one exception: in our WeBWorK online homework system,
              there is an <q>Email Instructor</q> button you can click to send feedback.
              This is useful if you think there's an error in the question,
              or if you've tried it several times and can't figure out why you're wrong.
              See <xref ref="subsec-webwork"/> for details.

              You can email me for questions that aren't related to course content.
              For example, if you have to miss class, or a test, you can email me to let me know.

      <title>Technology elements</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          To facilitate online teaching,
          our course will rely on several technological solutions.
          This section provides details on navigating the technology.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-webwork">
        <title>Online homework</title>
        <p>
          Online homework is delivered via WeBWorK.
          WeBWorK is an open source homework system that I maintain on a local server.
          This service is provided to you free of charge, and your data never leaves campus.
          <fn>Okay, this is not entirely true. Since faculty are expected to teach from home,
          your data does travel from campus to my house via the university VPN.</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of WeBWorK is that questions are automatically graded,
          providing you with immediate feedback on your work.
          This is an excellent source of guided practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To access WeBWorK</em>: simply click the relevant link in Moodle.
          You will be signed in automatically <mdash/> there is no user name or password.
          But keep in mind that if your session times out due to inactivity,
          you have to return to Moodle to log in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Submitting answers</em>: WeBWorK has an automatic preview feature.
          The mathematics in your answer will be rendered as you type.
          (You can turn this off in the user settings if you don't like it.)
          If everything looks good, click the Submit button.
          The system will immediately respond with <q>Correct</q> or <q>Incorrect</q>.
          If your answer is correct, there is nothing more to do: your answer has been recorded,
          and you have credit for that problem.
          If your answer is incorrect, you get to try again.
          (<em>Exception</em>: I typically do not give unlimited attempts for true/false and multiple choice questions.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Other notes</em>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Some questions are <q>scaffolded</q> <mdash /> there are multiple parts,
                and you need to complete one part before being allowed to access the next.
                For these, you want to click the Preview Answers button, rather than Submit,
                to check your work and move on to the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you need to include scientific units in an answer,
                the automatic equation rendering can cause trouble.
                There's a little tool bar on the right hand side that lets you switch to <em>text mode</em> to enter units.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At the bottom of each page is an <q>Email Instructor</q> button.
                If you are stuck on a problem, or if you think there is an error in the programming (it happens!)
                you can use this to let me know.
                WeBWorK will send me an email with your message,
                along with a link to the exact version of the problem you were working on.
                Often I can figure out where you're going wrong by looking at your answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please <em>do not</em> use the email button to ask me how to solve a problem.
                That's what the discussion forum is for.
                It should only be used afer you've made several attempts at the problem,
                or if you see an error message of some sort.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, some general advice: WeBWorK is not a new addition for the online environment.
          I've used it for awhile. The students who do well in this course are the ones who start their problem sets early.
          Please do not wait until the due date to begin: it leaves you no time to ask questions!
          The most effective way to use WeBWorK is to read the relevant portion of the textbook,
          try the problems, and then ask for help on the ones you're stuck on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and please do not wait until you've made 50 unsuccessful attempts at a problem to ask for help.
          If you haven't figured out a question after 5 or 6 attempts, set it aside, and come back to it a bit later.
          If you still can't figure it out, go the discussion forum.

        <title>Crowdmark</title>
        <p>
          Tests and assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark.
          Like WeBWorK, Crowdmark is connected to Moodle,
          so you just have to click a link in Moodle to access your assessement and submit your work.
          Unlike WeBWorK, Crowdmark lets you do your work using pencil and paper.
          For ease of reference, I've placed <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/crowdmark.html">advice for using Crowdmark</url>

            <li>
              <p>
                Start each question on a clean sheet of paper.

            <li>
              <p>
                Use a scanner, or a scanning app on your smartphone.
                PDF is best, but JPG and PNG files are also supported.

          I may choose to record some parts of our classes on Zoom.
          Any time I record, you will receive a warning (in case you want to turn off your camera, perhaps).
          Note that Zoom does not record breakout rooms.
          Typically, I will only record when I am presenting the solution to a problem.
          Those recordings will then be posted on YouTube for later access.

                you can raise your hand using the Zoom participants list.
                Once I invite you to ask your question, you can unmute and ask it.

            During most Zoom sessions, you will be put into smaller breakout rooms to work on problems.
            Breakout rooms are not recorded, and I cannot actively monitor the breakout rooms <mdash />
            these are essentially private working sessions for your group.
            I <em>do</em> have the ability to join a breakout room temporarily,
            but will only do so when invited.
            If you need my help during a breakout session, there is an <q>Ask for help</q> button you can use to get my attention.

            You will be encouraged to use Microsoft OneNote to collaborate with your group.
            OneNote lets you type notes, insert photos, and use handwriting, if you have a touch-enabled device.
            Unlike the Zoom chat and whiteboard features,
            your OneNote notebook will remain available after class for you to refer to.
            See <xref ref="subsec-onenote"/> for more details.

          OneNote will be used both for class presentations,
          and for student collaboration.
          Details here will include how to access class notebooks,
          how to edit collaboratively, how to print, <etc />.

          Students will have access to OneNote through their Office 365 accounts,
          and IT is working on getting it integrated with Moodle.
          I'll update this section once details are finalized with IT.

        This page outlines the list of competencies each student is expected to achieve in Math 1560.
        There are five <q>big themes,</q> corresponding to the five chapters of the textbook.
        (The number following each outcome below indicates the corresponding textbook section.)
        The online homework, tutorial assignments, and tests are all designed to help you achieve these outcomes.

      <p>
        <alert>Note:</alert> this list of learning outcomes should also serve as your outline for the final exam.
        The exam might not be able to test <em>all</em> outcomes, but all outcomes are potentially on the exam.
