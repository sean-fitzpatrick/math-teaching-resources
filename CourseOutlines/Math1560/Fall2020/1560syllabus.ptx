          As you embark upon your study of calculus in this course (Math 1560),
          you likely have many questions, such as: <q>What is Calculus, anyway?</q>
          and <q>Is this on the test?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition to online teaching prompts even more questions.
          This outline is intended to serve as a roadmap,
          to guide you through the various components of the course.

      <title>Introduction to Math 1560</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Welcome to Math 1560, Calculus I.
          I'm glad you've chosen to embark on this journey through a mathematical classic.
          The Fall 2020 offering of this course will be an adventure,
          as I attempt to offer the course fully online for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's get one thing out of the way before we begin:
          Calculus I isn't nearly as bad as its reputation might suggest.
          Most students who put in the work do well in Math 1560
          <fn>In Fall 2019, out of 262 students who completed the course,
          104 received a grade of A- or better. (That's almost 40% of the class.)
          More than two thirds of the class received A or B grades.</fn>.
          We will do our best to support you in your online learning,
          and ensure that students continue to do well in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many of us in this class, coming from many different backgrounds and situations.
          If the <q>default settings</q> for the class don't work for you,
          please don't hesitate to ask for accommodation.
          Not everyone has reliable high speed internet.
          Not everyone is able to attend scheduled classes without work/family/life getting in the way.
          But everyone deserves a fulfilling, enjoyable learning experience in each class.
          (Yes, including calculus. You are here to experience the joy of doing mathematics, no?)
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin with some introductions: to the university, to the staff, and to the course.
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-welcome">
        <title>Welcome to the University of Lethbridge</title>
        <p>
          Oki, and welcome to the University of Lethbridge.
          Our University’s Blackfoot name is Iniskim, meaning Sacred Buffalo Stone.
          The University of Lethbridge acknowledges and deeply appreciates the Siksikaitsitapii peoples’ connection to their traditional territory.
          We, as people living and benefiting from Blackfoot Confederacy traditional territory,
          honour the traditions of people who have cared for this land since time immemorial.
          We recognize the diverse population of Aboriginal peoples who attend the University of Lethbridge and the
          contributions these Aboriginal peoples have made in shaping and strengthening the University community in the
          past, present, and in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of you, this is your first semester at the University of Lethbridge,
          or at any post-secondary institution.
          University is an exciting time. You'll be exposed to new people,
          new ideas, and new experiences.
          Making connections as we learn remotely will be a challenge,
          but somehow we'll do our best to make this happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of your courses, including this one, will be facilitated using the
          <url href="https://moodle.uleth.ca">Moodle</url> learning management system.
          You'll want to spend time as soon as you can familiarizing yourself with your course Moodle pages,
          and plan to check each one on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transitioning to learning in the university environment is a challenge at the best of times.
          Doing so in the middle of a global pandemic while also trying to learn online,
          and learn to use all the technological tools needed for that, will be additionally challenging.
          Everyone here at U of L will be doing our best to help you through this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.
          I'll do my best to answer all of your course-related questions as quickly as possible.
          (See <xref ref="section-communication">Section</xref> for details on how to get in touch.)
          If you have questions that are not related to the course,
          you can ask those too, and I'll try to answer, or to direct you to someone who can.
        </p>
        <p>

          Math 1560 is running in three sections for Fall 2020: A, B, and C.
          My name is <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat">Sean Fitzpatrick</url>.
          I'm in charge of all three lecture sections (A, B, and C).
          I can be reached via email at

        <p>
          <alert>Office hours:</alert> as long as it's convenient for most students,
          I will extend our scheduled Zoom classes to include office hours.
          That is, I'll stick around for half an hour after class ends to answer questions.
          (Section B runs until 5:45 pm, and by that time I'll have been on Zoom for 5-6 hours.
          I might choose to do office hours for Section B <em>before</em> class.)
          Check Moodle for the most up to date information on office hours.
          I will also use Moodle's <term>Scheduler</term> booking system to let you book individual appointments.

        <p>
          Tutorial sections 4, 9, 11, and 12 are taught by <url href="mailto:jana.archibald@uleth.ca">Dr. Jana Archibald</url>.
          All the other tutorial sections are taught by <url href="mailto:azar.eftekharitarghi@uleth.ca">Azar Efekhari Targhi</url>.
          Jana and Azar handled our Summer 2020 offering of Math 1560,
          so they've already had their first adventure in teaching calculus online,
          and I'll be relying on their experience and expertise with what works best online.

        <title>Course description</title>
        <p>
          This is Math 1560, Calculus I. It's a first course in calculus,
          covering limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of one variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll be dealing with all your favourite functions from high school:
          polynomials, logarithms, exponentials, even trigonometric functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><term>Limits</term> tell us about the value of a function near a point.
            A limit is simulataneously approximate and precise. In fact, most of calculus could be described as <q>the art of precise approximation</q></li>
            <li><term>Derivatives</term> tell us about how a function is <em>changing</em> near a point.
            Most rates of change in the sciences, from speed to population growth, are quantified using derivatives.</li>
            <li><term>Integrals</term> will be defined in the context of calclating area,
            but they also appear whenever aggregates or averages are being considered.</li>
          </ul>
          Both derivatives and intergrals are defined using limits, and the two are related in a (possibly) surprising way.
        </p>

      <subsection xml:id="pars-online">
        <title>And what about the whole online thing?</title>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The course is set up with synchronous meetings (via Zoom)
          that follow the original timetable.
          It's great if you can come to these. There will be opportinuties for discussion,
          and to work on problems (including ones you'll be handing in)
          with your classmates.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also understandable if you can't. Bad internet.
          Bosses who don't understand that online classes still have, well, classes.
          Maybe you have to share your computer with your little brother.
          Maybe travel restrictions mean that when class meets, it's 2 am where you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, I'll do my best to also support asynchronous learning.
          Lots can be done on your own time, even if you do make it to class.
          The textbook is free, online, and full of videos.
          We'll run an online Q&amp;A forum you can use to ask questions any time of day.
          Tests <alert>are not</alert> during class time. You'll have a 24 hour window.
        </p>

        <p>
          In <xref ref="subsec-grading"/> you're going to see that there are lots of pieces to your grade.
          And yes, most of them have deadlines. But don't worry!
          Most of those pieces are small: designed to be done in class,
          or to take up no more than an hour or so of your time.
          Learning any kind of math is a marathon, not a sprint.
          So I'm giving you a little bit to do every day.
          Keep at it, and you'll do well.

        <p>
          The primary course website is <url href="https://moodle.uleth.ca">Moodle</url>.
          On Moodle, you can expect to find:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Links to key course activities, including the online homework,
                and the discussion forum. (The links will log you into those services automatically.)

        <p>
          As you learn to navigate online learning (and as I learn how to guide you),
          the weekly topics schedules will be key to staying on top of your course material.
          Every week you can expect to receive details on readings, videos,
          homework, and assessments, as well as information on what will be taking place in class,
          and how to access those classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case there's a day when Moodle isn't working properly and you need access to course materials,
          you can find some of them (like this syllabus) on my <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/teaching.html">personal website</url>.

          Math 1560 will be taught using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction.
          Asynchronous components are explained in later sections.
          We have maintained the originally scheduled class meeting times,
          which are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <dl>

        </p>
        <p>
          You should try to attend your assigned section, or it'll mess up the group work dynamics.
          But that's not always realistic, so attend when you can. (I won't tell the Registrar if you don't.)
          Let me know if you want to change times permanently.
          And if group members are expecting you, let them know too!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a weekly <em>tutorial</em>.
          Tutorials take place on Thursday and Friday.
          Since there are 11 tutorial sections, we won't list them all here.
          The easiest way to access your tutorial information is by looking up your personal schedule on <url href="https://bridge.uleth.ca/">the Bridge</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes will be a mixture of Q&amp;A (where I do examples by request)
          and group work (using Zoom's <term>breakout room</term> feature).
          Sometimes I will provide a problem for discussion that you will work on as a group,
          and then we'll reconvene as a class to compare group responses.
          You will also have time in class to work on group assignments,
          and after each test there will be a group test that takes place in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Q&amp;A portion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can use the discussion forum to recommend problems for us to discuss.
                (See <xref ref="section-communication"/>. I'll run a live Q&amp;A session on Piazza.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Once we choose a question to solve, I'll give the class an opportunity for input on how to solve it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I will record my solution (based on your input) and upload later to YouTube.
                Recording will be done so that only my video is captured.
                (That is: if you all want to turn on your cameras so I can see your smiling/frowning faces,
                I promise not to record you and put it on YouTube.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutorials will be synchronous, and facilitated by a tutorial instructor.
          You will use tutorials to work on the basic computational skills essential to success in calculus.
          Work in tutorial will be done in groups, and graded for feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can't attend tutorial synchronously, please let me know.
          I'll try to accommodate. This is the one part of the class where I think you'll be way better off if you can attend in person.

        <title>Course textbook</title>
        <p>
          Our course textbook is <init>APEX</init> Calculus, by Greg Hartman.
          This book is an <term>open education resource</term> (<init>OER</init>).
          That means that the book is fully free, both in terms of cost,
          your freedom to use and share the book however you see fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If getting the book for free somehow feels wrong,
          or you worry you're missing out by not buying anything,
          here are two great books you can buy:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <url href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/mathematics-for-human-flourishing/9780300237139-item.html">Mathematics for Human Flourishing</url>,

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither of these books are in any way needed for the course.
          But they're cool books, and they're about math. (The second is even about Calculus!)
          So if you feel like you need to spend money on a book, you can.
          (Or I don't know, go to the library or something.)
        </p>
        <p>
          About APEX: For the last year or so,
          I've been working with Greg and others to convert the textbook to a system called <pretext/>.
          The <pretext/> language allows us to write a book that can be produced in a variety of formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a <init>PDF</init> version (the original format of the book),
          which will be available on Moodle.
          The <init>PDF</init> version is useful if you want to print the book,
          or simply want to be able to read when there is no access to internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real advantage of <pretext/> is that we can output to <init>HTML</init> format.
          The <init>HTML</init> version of the textbook can be found at
          <url href="https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-standard/part-calculus-I.html"/>.
          This version of the book can be read on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
          It also contains a number of nice features, including embedded videos,
          interactive graphics, and annotation tools.

        <title>Grading scheme</title>
        <p>
          Traditionally Math 1560 has been a mostly skills-focused course:
          the focus was on learning how to compute limits and derivatives,
          and the tests mostly checked your proficiency in these skills.
          This doesn't work well online, when most routine calculations can be done easily on the computer!
          Our assessment principles this year:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                No big high stakes assessments: lots of little ones instead.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                More concepts, and less rote computation.
                (Less <mdash/> not none. Your follow-on courses will still assume you know how to take a derivative.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Classes (the synchronous part) will be used for work, not lecture.
                (Nobody wants to sit though a 75 minute Zoom lecture on Calculus, including your instructor.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Group work is good for you. (Even if you don't always like it!)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The various graded components of the course are explained below.
          At first it will seem like there's a lot to do!
          But most items are small, and many can be done during class time.
        </p>

            <li>
              <title>Reading questions (5%)</title>
              <p>
                To encourage you to keep up to date with the textbook readings/videos,
                there will be a weekly quiz, delivered via WeBWorK.
                The quiz questions will check your reading; not your math.
                Reading questions will be due by 8 am every Wednesday.
                The main purpose of the questions is for me to be able to identify
                (from your responses) what areas of the content need to be addressed in class.
                Typically any reasonable effort to answer will receive full credit.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Tutorials (10%)</title>
              <p>
                Every tutorial will involve an assignment to be completed.
                You will be encouraged to work on these problems in groups.
                Evaluation will be strictly <em>formative</em>:
                you will receive feedback on the work that you submit,
                but any sincere demonstration of effort will receive full credit.
              </p>
              <p>
                In subsequent tutorials I may check to see if you've actually read the feedback you receive.
                Since you're not being graded on whether you're right or wrong,
                we'll use tutorials as an opportunity for you to learn all the basic computational skills.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Online Homework (10%)</title>
              <p>
                The homework, like tutorial,
                will focus on building fluency with the computational procedures of calculus.
                You can expect a new problem set every week.
                Homework will be delivered through the <term>WeBWorK</term> online homework system.
                See <xref ref="subsec-webwork"/> for details.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Assignments (10%)</title>
              <p>
                Assignments will be done in groups,
                and there will be time set aside in each class to work on them.
                Each assignment have only one or two problems,
                but these will typically involve multiple steps,
                and you will be graded as much on the quality of your explanation as on the validity of your mathematics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typically a written assignment is expected,
                but interested students are encouraged to explore alternative formats.
                For example, if a group wants to submit a video presentation instead of written work,
                that sounds like fun, and I will totally be on board with that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is a fictitious (but possibly informative) grading rubric for assignments:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      A: wow, they clearly discussed this as a group, and nailed down all the key points!
                      I also appreciate how the work is legible and relatively free of frustrated scribbling.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      B: everyone had something to say, but I'm not sure they all agreed.
                      There's an obvious mistake that someone should have caught,
                      suggesting that nobody thought to read it over before submitting.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      C: most of the details are there but this was clearly done in the last hour before the deadline.
                      Also, it looks suspiciously like one person did all the work.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      D: looks like parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) were each done by a different person,
                      and then arranged randomly on the page.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      F: nothing submitted. Or work is a crude drawing of what appears to be an integral attacking a kitten.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Tests (65%)</title>
              <p>
                Each of the five chapters will conclude with a test.
                The test will be open book. There will be a time limit,
                but you will have some flexibility in terms of when you choose to begin.
                Details on test dates can be found in <xref ref="section-schedule"/>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following grading notes apply. Each test is worth a total of 13 points.
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Prior to each test you will be asked to submit a <q>study sheet</q>.
                      This will be worth 2 points.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      You will be asked to give (anonymous) feedback on the study sheets of three other students.
                      This will be worth 1 point.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      You will write the test <em>individually</em>,
                      and submit via <term>Crowdmark</term>.
                      The individual test will be worth 6 points.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After the individual test, there will be a follow-up <em>group test</em>.
                      This will take place in class, and will be worth 2 points.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      After your test has been graded,
                      you will be asked to submit a short reflection piece,
                      where you comment on your performance and the feedback you receive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Typically, you will be asked to comment on the following:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What did you do to prepare for the test?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What types of mistakes did you make on the test?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            What (if anything) could you do differently next time?
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Post-test reflection will also be worth 2 points.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      There are five tests in total.
                      I will automatically take your best 4 out of 5 test scores.
                      That way you can miss a test (or have a bad day) without affecting your grade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Notice that the individual portion of the test (<ie/> <q>the test</q>)
                      is only worth just under half the total test grade.
                      So you can tank the test and still pass the test, if that makes sense.
                      (But if you've done the pre-test activity I bet you won't tank it.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Note that the group test is scheduled to take place in class.
                      I will be working to identify students for whom this would be a hardship.
                      Those of you who legitimately cannot attend (you know, for reasons)
                      will be grouped together and given an alternative activity.
                    </p>

              <title>Participation</title>
              <p>
                Participation credit can be earned as follows:
                <ul>

              <p>
                Participation is not required, and does not directly affect your grade.
                Quality participation is regular (at least weekly),
                and enhances the learning experience for your classmates.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many students, life intervenes and you miss a deadline,
                forget an assignment, <etc/>
                Participation is your way to demonstrate continued engagement in the class,
                even if you mess up on the occasional assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
                With that in mind, participation credit is <alert>redeemable</alert>.
                <fn>
                  To redeem: send me an email that says something like,
                  <q>Hey Sean, I need two more days on that homework assignment,
                  and by the way, did you notice I answered three questions on the forum this week?</q>

              </p>
              <p>

                Alternatively, you can save up those participation credits for the <term>big ask</term>.
                Namely, there comes a point at the end of semester where a student looks at their grade,
                (and possibly <xref ref="table-lettergrade"/> below) and sends an email saying something like,
                <q>But I'm only 2% away from an A-!</q>
                If you've been participating regularly throughout the semester,
                I may be willing to entertain such a request.

          Each of the grade components above will be assigned a numerical score.
          These will be added to get a score out of 100.
          Your score out of 100 is converted into a letter grade according to the following table.

        The following communication channels are available in this course:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Forums</title>
            <p>
              There will be a primary course Q&amp;A forum using <url href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</url>.
              We use Piazza rather than the internal Moodle forums due to a couple of useful features:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Students can choose to remain anonymous (to their peers) when asking a question.

                <li>

            </p>
            <p>
              The Piazza forum should be your primary communication channel.
              In particular, any questions about homework and course content should be asked on Piazza,
              since I can reply there with mathematical notation.
              You will also get a much faster reply on the forum than you will from email.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is one exception: in our WeBWorK online homework system,
              there is an <q>Email Instructor</q> button you can click to send feedback.
              This is useful if you think there's an error in the question,
              or if you've tried it several times and can't figure out why you're wrong.

      <title>Technology elements</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          To facilitate online teaching,
          our course will rely on several technological solutions.
          This section provides details on navigating the technology.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-webwork">
        <title>Online homework</title>
        <p>
          Online homework is delivered via WeBWorK.
          WeBWorK is an open source homework system that I maintain on a local server.
          This service is provided to you free of charge, and your data never leaves campus.
          <fn>Okay, this is not entirely true. Since faculty are expected to teach from home,
          your data does travel from campus to my house via the university VPN.</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of WeBWorK is that questions are automatically graded,
          providing you with immediate feedback on your work.
          This is an excellent source of guided practice.
        </p>
        <video youtube="79kRzUV7f2U" xml:id="video-webwork"/>
        <p>
          <em>To access WeBWorK</em>: simply click the relevant link in Moodle.
          You will be signed in automatically <mdash/> there is no user name or password.
          But keep in mind that if your session times out due to inactivity,
          you have to return to Moodle to log in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Submitting answers</em>: WeBWorK has an automatic preview feature.
          The mathematics in your answer will be rendered as you type.
          (You can turn this off in the user settings if you don't like it.)
          If everything looks good, click the Submit button.
          The system will immediately respond with <q>Correct</q> or <q>Incorrect</q>.
          If your answer is correct, there is nothing more to do: your answer has been recorded,
          and you have credit for that problem.
          If your answer is incorrect, you get to try again.
          (<em>Exception</em>: I typically do not give unlimited attempts for true/false and multiple choice questions.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Other notes</em>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Some questions are <q>scaffolded</q> <mdash /> there are multiple parts,
                and you need to complete one part before being allowed to access the next.
                For these, you want to click the Preview Answers button, rather than Submit,
                to check your work and move on to the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you need to include scientific units in an answer,
                the automatic equation rendering can cause trouble.
                There's a little tool bar on the right hand side that lets you switch to <em>text mode</em> to enter units.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At the bottom of each page is an <q>Email Instructor</q> button.
                If you are stuck on a problem, or if you think there is an error in the programming (it happens!)
                you can use this to let me know.
                WeBWorK will send me an email with your message,
                along with a link to the exact version of the problem you were working on.
                Often I can figure out where you're going wrong by looking at your answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please <em>do not</em> use the email button to ask me how to solve a problem.
                That's what the discussion forum is for.
                It should only be used afer you've made several attempts at the problem,
                or if you see an error message of some sort.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, some general advice: WeBWorK is not a new addition for the online environment.
          I've used it for awhile. The students who do well in this course are the ones who start their problem sets early.
          Please do not wait until the due date to begin: it leaves you no time to ask questions!
          The most effective way to use WeBWorK is to read the relevant portion of the textbook,
          try the problems, and then ask for help on the ones you're stuck on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and please do not wait until you've made 50 unsuccessful attempts at a problem to ask for help.
          If you haven't figured out a question after 5 or 6 attempts, set it aside, and come back to it a bit later.
          If you still can't figure it out, go the discussion forum.

        <p>
          Tests and assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark.
          Like WeBWorK, Crowdmark is connected to Moodle,
          so you just have to click a link in Moodle to access your assessement and submit your work.
          Unlike WeBWorK, Crowdmark lets you do your work using pencil and paper.
          For ease of reference, I've placed <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/crowdmark.html">advice for using Crowdmark</url>

          Basic advice:

            <li>
              <p>
                Start each question on a clean sheet of paper.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Use a scanner, or a scanning app on your smartphone.
                PDF is best, but JPG and PNG files are also supported.

            <li>

          Classes and tutorials will meet using Zoom.

          I may choose to record some parts of our classes on Zoom.
          Any time I record, you will receive a warning (in case you want to turn off your camera, perhaps).
          Note that Zoom does not record breakout rooms.
          Typically, I will only record when I am presenting the solution to a problem.
          Those recordings will then be posted on YouTube for later access.

            During most Zoom sessions, you will be put into smaller breakout rooms to work on problems.
            Breakout rooms are not recorded, and I cannot actively monitor the breakout rooms <mdash />
            these are essentially private working sessions for your group.
            I <em>do</em> have the ability to join a breakout room temporarily,

              Short answer: yes. I recognize that not all students have access to the same technology.
              If your home internet is unreliable, attending Zoom sessions could be a challenge.
              If you can't attend synchronous sessions, I will arrange alternatives for graded work done asynchronously.
              I will also try to connect you with other students in the same situation,
              so that you still have a group you can work with.

            <title>What happens if I get sick?</title>
            <p>
              I'll do my best to be accommodating of any illness that interrupts your studies.
              There is no need to provide details of the illness.
              If you miss a week or more of work, please get in touch to make a plan for catching up.
              One of the biggest challenges in math is that once you fall behind,
              it's difficult to catch up on your own.

            <title>What exactly does academic honesty mean?</title>
            <p>
              In short, that any work you represent as your own, is your own.
              Much of your work can be done in groups, but not all of it.
              I will assume that you have access to a calculator,
              including online tools (like <url href="https://www.symbolab.com/">Symbolab</url>)
              that give you step-by-step solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use of these tools is acceptable, but take care that you are not overly reliant on them.
              What is not acceptable is having someone else do your work for you.
              This includes tutors, classmates, friends, family members, and online <q>homework help</q> sites.
              If you are paying money in exchange for answers to graded work,
              you are committing an academic offence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Penalties for academic dishonesty are outlined in the
              <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/policy/resources/student-discipline-policy-academic-offences-undergraduate-students">Academic Calendar</url>.
              Depending on the severity of the offence, penalties for a first offence can range from a grade of zero on an assessment,
              to an F in the courses.
              Academic offences are also reported to the Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences.
              They keep a record of each offence, and students with multiple offences can be subject to supplementary discipline.
            </p>

          <li>
            <title>Does that mean I'm not allowed to get help with my homework?</title>
            <p>
              Not at all! But keep in mind that your course instructors will be available for help,
              free of charge. (OK, maybe not free of charge, but you've already paid for it with your tuition.)
              We will be responding on the discussion forum regularly,
              There will be time to ask questions in every class, and there will be online office hours.
              The Student Success Centre will also be running free help sessions (details TBA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of you may still decide to pay for tutoring, and that's fine.
              But you have a duty to disclose sources of help on an assignment,
              and the individual tests are still tests, even if you won't have someone watching over your shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should probably avoid the various paid <q>homework help</q> websites.
              Most of these don't offer help. They offer worked solutions for a price.
              Getting those solutions won't help with your understanding.
              More importantly, the people working for these sites are paid (poorly) per solution,
              and they often provide incorrect and/or badly written work.
              (We saw plenty of examples of this last Spring, and yes, all those students now have discipline reports on file.)

          <li>
            <title>I missed a test! What do I do? Do I get a zero?</title>
            <p>
              First, contact me as soon as possible for any missed test.
              There are <em>five</em> tests, and I only count <em>four</em> towards your grade.
              As long as you only miss one test, there is no penalty.
              This is true regardless of your reason for missing the test.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>What if I really wanted to write that test?</title>
            <p>
              Inform me of this when you contact me to explain your absence.
              There's no guarantee that I can schedule a makeup test, but I'll try.
              You're more likely to get a makeup test if you've contacted me in advance.

            <title>Do I need a doctor's note?</title>
            <p>
              No. This wastes health care resources and your time.
              (That was my answer before the pandemic, and it's doubly so now.)
              Just email me to say you were sick.
              However, if you miss more than one test due to illness,
              we'll need to meet to discuss how to adjust your grade.

            <title>I receive learning accommodations. What arrangements can I make?</title>
            <p>
              First, make sure that you have registered with the University's
              <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre">Accommodated Learning Centre</url>.
              No need to let me know: they notify me of every student with accommodations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some accommodations will look a bit different this year,
              but exam accommodations such as extra time are still possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there are any adjustments I can make
              to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
              All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn.
              Note that the <init>HTML</init> textbook is designed with accessibility in mind,
              and should work with screen readers.
              However, I regret that we have not had the time (or paid help) necessary to add elements such as alt-text descriptions for images.
              It's on the to-do list, but that list is long, and growing.

            <title>Life intervened and I can't keep up this week. What do I do?</title>
            <p>
              Send me an email. Extensions are usually granted as long as they're granted ahead of time.
              Online homework extensions need to be in place before solutions become available.
              Book an appointment with me as soon as you feel like you're falling behind and I'll do my best to get you up to speed.

        <p>
          Every class will have some time for Q&amp;A, and for discussion.
          Wednesday classes will have time dedicated to group work.
          Depending on the week, this group work could be the group portion of a test,
          or time to work on one of the assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online homework assignments will be due Mondays.
          This is because tests will run on Tuesdays,
          and you are better off on a test if you've done your homework ahead of time.
