              As you embark upon your study of calculus in this course (Math 1560),
                you likely have many questions, such as: <q>What is Calculus, anyway?</q>
                and <q>Is this on the test?</q>
                This outline will attempt to answer your questions,
                along with many others you did not think to ask.

          <introduction>
            <p>
              Welcome to Math 1560, Calculus I. And welcome to the University of Lethbridge,
              for those of you just beginning your university career.
              I am pleased to include the following (now official!) message of welcome:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Oki, and welcome to the University of Lethbridge.
                Our University’s Blackfoot name is Iniskim, meaning Sacred Buffalo Stone.
                The University of Lethbridge acknowledges and deeply appreciates the Siksikaitsitapii peoples’ connection to their traditional territory.
                We, as people living and benefiting from Blackfoot Confederacy traditional territory,
                honour the traditions of people who have cared for this land since time immemorial.
                We recognize the diverse population of Aboriginal peoples who attend the University of Lethbridge and the
                contributions these Aboriginal peoples have made in shaping and strengthening the University community in the
                past, present, and in the future.

              My name is <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat">Sean Fitzpatrick</url>.
              You'll see me twice each week in class (right?), and I also handle most of the day-to-day organization.
              For any questions that you don't find answered in this outline,
              <fn>Except questions about homework <ndash/> there's a forum for that.</fn>
              you can email me at <url href="mailto:sean.fitzpatrick@uleth.ca">sean.fitzpatrick@uleth.ca</url>,
              or drop by my office: C540 in University Hall.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sean's office hours are Monday from 1 <ndash/> 3 pm,
              and Wednesday from 9 <ndash/> 11 am. (These are open drop-in hours.)
              If those times don't work for you, please email for an appointment.
              Usually I have time on Friday, but due to meetings scheduled at irregular times,
              I'm not able to set a fixed hour.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will also meet once each week for a <term>tutorial</term>.
              Your tutorial instructor will depend on your section.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sections 1 through 6 are taught by <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~bomhof">Arie Bomhof</url>.
              He can be reached via email at <url href="mailto:a.bomhof@uleth.ca">a.bomhof@uleth.ca</url>.

                    <em>New for 2019:</em> I spent most of the summer working with several other people
                    to convert the code used to generate the <init>PDF</init>
                    version of our textbook into an <init>XML</init> language
                    <fn>Called <url href="https://pretextbook.org">PreTeXt</url> <mdash/> it's also the language used to make this outline!</fn>
                    that allows us to generate an interactive <init>HTML</init> version.
                    The <init>HTML</init> version should look much better than the <init>PDF</init>
                    if you're viewing it on a phone or tablet.
                    It also includes features like embedded videos and interactive exercises.

            <subsubsection>
              <title>Can I get a print copy of the textbook?</title>
              <p>Yes. I recommend using the Print-on-Demand service from the Campus Bookstore.
                They will print and bind copy of the book for you.
                It usually takes no more than a day to get a print copy from the Bookstore.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can also print it yourself.
                The open license for our textbook means that you are free to do whatever you
                want with your electronic copy,
                and this includes printing it.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What does a typical lecture look like?</title>

              <p>
                Generally we'll try to avoid a full 75 minutes of lecture,
                and leave time for hands-on work.
                This means that you should <em>not</em> expect to see every bit of course content presented in detail during class.
                Instead, you'll be responsible for reviewing content,
                using the textbook, or videos (or both), prior to class.
                At the start of class, I might do some informal polling to see how well everyone did at preparing,
                and you'll have a chance to ask questions about content you struggled with.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll go over some main highlights of the content for the day,
                and do a few examples.
                After that, you'll have an opportunity to try some problems yourself.
                Most days you can expect pencil and paper work,
                occasionally we might work with computers as well.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What do we do in the tutorials?</title>
              <p>
                Each tutorial will involve an in-class assignment,
                which you will complete and submit for feedback.
                Everyone has to submit their own assignment,
                but collaboration is allowed, and you can ask for help from the tutorial instructor.
                The point of the tutorial assignments is to give you an opportunity for guided practice
                in a smaller class (tutorials are set at 30 students each),
                and to get feedback on your writing in a low-stakes environment,
                so you know what's expected on the tests.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>How do I find you if I need help with something?</title>
                <p>
                  My office is C540, in University Hall.
                  Arie Bomhof is down the hall, in C510.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Office hours will be available on Moodle and maybe even on our office doors.
                </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>Do I need to make an appointment for office hours?
                What if I have class at that time?</title>
              <p>
                You don't need an appointment -- just drop in.
                <term>Office hours</term> are the times that I promise
                to be available for consultation.
                If the times I choose don't work, you can email me for an appointment.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What if my question is not related to the course?</title>
              <p>
                Come see me anyway, or send an email.
                If I can't help you myself, I'll try to direct you to someone who can.
                There's also some

              <title>OK, but what if it's kind of personal?</title>
              <p>
                If it affects your ability to participate in the course
                (or even if it doesn't), you can come talk to me.
                In many cases, you might be best off seeing Academic Advising or Counselling Services.

              <title>What do we learn in Math 1560?</title>
                <p>
                  We'll be dealing with all your favourite functions from high school:
                  polynomials, logarithms, exponentials, trig functions, <etc/> while learning about
                  limits, derivatives, and integrals.

                      <p>
                        <term>Limits</term> tell us about the value of a function near a point.
                        A limit is simultaneously approximate and precise.
                        In fact, most of calculus could be described as
                        <q>the art of precise approximation</q>.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      <p>
                        <term>Derivatives</term> tell us about how a function is <em>changing</em> near a point.
                        Most rates of change in the sciences, from speed to population growth,
                        are quantified using derivatives.

                      <p>
                        <term>Integrals</term> will be defined in the context of calculating area,
                        but they also appear whenever aggregates or averages are being considered.

                  Both derivatives and integrals are defined using limits,
                  and the two are related in a (possibly) surprising way.

              <p>
                To be fair, most of the learning outcomes are tied to the material, but there are some fringe benefits.

                      You'll learn how to <em>write</em>. Really.
                      Technical writing is a skill that must be learned.
                      Solving a mathematical problem, and knowing how to communicate your results,
                      are two different skills. You'll learn to do both in this course.

            <subsubsection>
              <title>What is involved with each of the graded components?</title>
              <p>
                Here are brief descriptions of each one:
                <dl>
                  <li>
                    <title>Online homework</title>
                    <p>
                      We use the <term>WeBWorK</term> online homework system.
                      A new problem set will be posted each week.
                      The system gives you immediate feedback on your answer,
                      and you usually have unlimited attempts to get it right.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The main point of the online homework is for you to get <em>practice</em>.
                      Yes, you can probably find dishonest means of completing the assignments,
                      but then you're likely to fail the tests.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <title>Tutorial assignments</title>
                    <p>
                      In each tutorial, you'll receive a set of problems to complete.
                      These problems must be submitted for feedback at the end of tutorial.
                      The grading policy is as follows:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            If our graders can find nothing wrong with your work, you'll receive full credit for that tutorial.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            If there are mistakes in your math, or in your presentation, you'll receive half credit for that tutorial.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            If you don't receive full credit the first time, you can submit corrections to improve your grade.
                            You can make corrections in person, during office hours, by simply explaining what you did wrong.
                            You can also attach corrections and resubmit during your next tutorial.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <em>Note:</em> corrections will typically be due within two weeks of your tutorial,
                            unless our graders are delayed in returning your work to you.
                            Corrections for the second-last tutorial must be done during office hours prior to the final exam.
                            Due to grading logistics, your final tutorial will be graded based solely on attendance.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            There are 11 tutorials, and your best 10 count for your grade.
                            A missed tutorial counts as a grade of zero, unless it's an excused absence.
                            See <xref ref="section-policy"/> for details.

                    <p>
                      There will be five tests <mdash/> one for each chapter of the textbook.
                      (See <xref ref="section-schedule"/> for test dates.)
                      The tests will be <em>two-stage</em> tests. Stage one is an individual test,
                      consisting of both multiple-choice conceptual quesitons,
                      and written-answer (long form) questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Stage two is done in groups, and consists only of the multiple-choice portion.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <title>Final Exam</title>
                    <p>
                      A traditional, cumulative, three-hour exam.
                      Note that final exams are no longer scheduled according to the timetable,
                      so the date of the final exam will not be known until sometime in October.
                      You should plan to remain on campus for the entire exam period.
                      The Registrar's Office <em>will not</em> allow you to reschedule due to travel conflicts.

            <subsubsection>
              <title>How do I access the online homework?</title>
              <p>
                You will log in directly from Moodle.
                As long as you have access to a computer and an internet connection,
                you have access to WeBWorK.
                Note that authentication is handled by Moodle, rather than a username/password combination.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>
                Two-stage tests? How does that work?
              </title>
              <p>
                The group stage allows for immediate peer feedback on the results of the test.
                The tests are meant to be a <em>learning</em> opportunity,
                not simply a grading obstacle.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each test  is worth 10%  of your grade: either 8% individual,
                plus 2% group, or 10% individual, whichever is better.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>
                Wait, does that mean I can just skip the group stage and take my individual score?
              </title>
              <p>
                Technically, yes. But I don't recommend it.
                It's very rare that a student's group score is less,
                and the group discussion helps to ensure you've nailed down all the concepts,
                even if you think you got it all right the first time.
              </p>
            </subsubsection>

            <subsubsection>
              <title>How does regrading work for tutorials?</title>
              <p>
                The point of allowing resubmission is to encourage you to learn from your feedback.
                Experience tells me that if we give a numerical score,
                many of you won't bother to figure out what you did wrong.
              </p>

              <p>
                When we grade your corrections,
                we'll be looking for evidence that you made an honest effort to figure out where you went wrong and improve.
              </p>

              <title>How are letter grades calculated?</title>
              <p>Each of the grade components above will be assigned a numerical score.
                These will be added to get a score out of 100 using <xref ref="table-evaluation"/>.
                Your score out of 100 is converted into a letter grade according to the following table.

                Inform me of this when you contact me to explain your absence.
                There's no guarantee that I can schedule a makeup test, but I'll try.
                You're more likely to get a makeup test if you've contacted me in advance.

              <p>
                No. This wastes health care resources and your time.
                Just email me to say you were sick.
                However, if you miss more than one test due to illness,
                we'll need to meet to discuss how to adjust your grade.

                Same thing, for this, or other circumstances beyond your control. Send me an email,
                and we'll sort something out. But if there's a snowstorm forecast for the night before,
                maybe don't plan a trip to Calgary.

              <title>I receive learning accommodations. What arrangements can I make?</title>
              <p>
                First, make sure that you have registered with the University's
                <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre">Accommodated Learning Centre</url>.
                If you have exam accommodations, you'll need to schedule your exams with them.
                No need to let me know: they'll contact me to request a copy of your exam.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you require any in-class accommodations, or if there are any adjustments I can make
                to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
                All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn.

              <title>I write my tests with Accommodated Exams. How do I participate in the group stage? </title>
              <p>
                Make sure to meet with me early in the semester, and we'll figure out what works for you.
                In the past, some students have chosen to write the individual stage with Accommodated Exams,
                and then join the class prior to the group state. Others chose to write both stages with the class.

              <p>
                <em>I guess...</em> Officially, you're only supposed to use a <q>basic calculator</q> <mdash/>
                one that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Graphing calculators are definitely not allowed.
                Note that decmial approximations are rarely preferred over exact values.
                Questions are usually designed so that no calculator is needed. Try not to rely on yours.

                Send me an email. Extensions are usually granted as long as they're granted ahead of time.
                Online homework extensions need to be in place before solutions become available.

                If circumstances are conspiring to keep you from class on a regular basis, please meet with me
                to come up with a plan to get you through the course.

                Students are expected to abide by the policies and regulations as laid out in the
                <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/academic-calendar">Academic Calendar</url>.
                This includes the University's policies on plagiarism and academic misconduct.
                In Math 1560, this more or less amounts to not copying on the tests,
                and not getting someone else (including a website) to do your homework for you.

                      or emailed to the class as an announcement via Moodle.

                      Your best option is to ask me in person.

          <p>
            This page outlines the list of competencies each student is expected to achieve in Math 1560.
            There are five <q>big themes,</q> corresponding to the five chapters of the textbook.
            (The number following each outcome below indicates the corresponding textbook section.)
            The online homework, tutorial assignments, and tests are all designed to help you achieve these outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <alert>Note:</alert> this list of learning outcomes should also serve as your outline for the final exam.
            The exam might not be able to test <em>all</em> outcomes, but all outcomes are potentially on the exam.
